//Multithreaded Programing:
//Seperate parts of a program running at the same time (MULTITASKING)
//Thread = each part running individually

//Multitasking:
//1. Process (program that is running) based = multiple programs that are running
//2. Thread Based = run 2 or more sub tasks at the same time 

//Java is ONLY IN CHARGE of MuLtItHrEaDiNg!


//Single-core processors vs Multicore
//Single still exsist and are being used; two threads dont run at same time, but whenever cpu is idle with one thread, the other thread gets time
//Multicore: multiple threads running at same time
