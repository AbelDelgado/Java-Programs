SHIFT + DEL COPYS LINE AND THEN DELETES IT




BOOKMARKS ARE COOL!
CTRL+SHIFT+M makes a bookmak, so you don't have to scroll ALLLL the way to main
CTRL+SHIFT+. or CTRL+SHIFT+, toggles between them



CTRL+SHIFT+ -/+ = minimize/maxmimize all functions


Breakpoint
Click on one of the numbers to set a breakpoint
Then, if you use DEBUGGER (beside the compile button), it will stop wherever you set it.
You can then STEP through your program






Multiple public static void Mains (String[] args)
See CHAPTER 5 - Queues example (Part 6)
ie. 
runProgram2.main(null);






Using COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS in netbeans  (pg 165)
in the Projects tab, right click the top main folder, and click properties
Click run, select the main class and add your arguments there
arguments are saved as:

'This is an argument'

public static void main (String [] args)
args = { "This", "is", "an", "argument"};
           0       1    2       3
           
           
           
           
If using SYSTEM.IN.READ, you need to have: throws java.io.IOException 
STATIC - create only one function/variable that will be used across the entire class
