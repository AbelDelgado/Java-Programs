# Deleting Lines
`SHIFT + DEL` = _Copies line and then deletes it_   
  
`CTRL + DEL` = _delete current word_    

# Formating 
`CTRL + ?` = _instantly make a comment! OMG_  
  
`ALT + SHIFT + UP/DOWN` = _move a line up or down_  
  
`CTRL + SHIFT + -/+` = _minimize/maxmimize all functions_  
  
`CTRL + SPACE` = let netbeans try to AUTOFILL YOUR REQUUEST  

`CTRL + UP / DOWN` = _scroll up or down_  
    
`CTRL + SHIFT + UP` = _duplicate line AND paste below_      
    
`CTRL + CLICK CLASS` = takes you to that class    
  
### Bookmarks
`CTRL + SHIFT + M` = _makes a bookmak, so you don't have to scroll ALLLL the way to main_  
`CTRL + SHIFT + .` or `CTRL + SHIFT + ` = _toggles between the bookmarks you've made_
  
### Breakpoint
Click on one of the numbers to set a breakpoint  
Then, if you use DEBUGGER (beside the compile button), it will stop wherever you set it.  
You can then STEP through your program  
  
   
### Multiple public static void Mains (String[] args)  
See CHAPTER 5 - Queues example (Part 6)  
ie.    
runProgram2.main(null);   
  
It's like running a function called main in your real main  

# Easy System.out.println("");
typing "sout" and then pressing tab creates a System.out.println("");    
  
    
  
# Using COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS in netbeans  (pg 165)  
in the Projects tab, right click the top main folder, and click properties  
Click run, select the main class and add your arguments there  
arguments are saved as:  
  
'This is an argument'  
  
public static void main (String [] args)  
args = { "This", "is", "an", "argument"};  
           0       1    2       3  
  
           
           
           
If using SYSTEM.IN.READ, you need to have: throws java.io.IOException 
STATIC - create only one function/variable that will be used across the entire class
Packages = simply groups of classes
